# ?? Quick Railway Deployment Check

## ? Changes Pushed to GitHub

Your latest commit has been successfully pushed:
- **Commit:** `20d731c`
- **Message:** "Fix: Replace non-existent claude-agent-sdk with official Anthropic SDK"
- **Branch:** `main`

## ?? What to Do Next

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
Go to: https://railway.app/

You should see:
- ? New deployment triggered automatically
- ? Build logs showing successful `pip install`
- ? Deployment status: "Active"

### 2. Watch Build Logs

Look for these SUCCESS indicators:
```
? Collecting anthropic>=0.19.0
? Successfully installed anthropic-0.x.x
? Build completed successfully
```

### 3. Set Environment Variable (if not already set)

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Variables"
3. Add: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = `sk-ant-api03-your-key-here`
4. Redeploy if needed

### 4. Test Your Deployment

```bash
# Check health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Check AI health
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/ai/health

# Expected response (without API key):
{
  "ai_enabled": false,
  "model": null,
  "features": []
}

# Expected response (with API key):
{
  "ai_enabled": true,
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "features": [
    "content_moderation",
    "spam_detection",
    "conversation_summary",
    "smart_replies",
    "ai_generation"
  ]
}
```

## ?? If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check Railway Logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Branch** - Make sure Railway is deploying from `main` branch
3. **Clear Cache** - Try redeploying with cache cleared
4. **Check Build Command** - Should use `Dockerfile` or `Procfile`

## ?? Railway Deployment URL

Your app should be at:
- https://natural-presence-production.up.railway.app
- Or your custom Railway domain
