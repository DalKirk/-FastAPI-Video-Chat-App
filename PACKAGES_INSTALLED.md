## ?? Note About Your Project

Your FastAPI Video Chat application **already uses FastAPI**, not Flask. The packages you requested are now installed, but note:

### Current Stack (FastAPI):
- ? **FastAPI** - Your main web framework
- ? **Uvicorn** - ASGI server
- ? **anthropic** - Claude AI SDK (newly installed latest version)
- ? **python-dotenv** - Environment variables

### Newly Installed (Flask):
- **Flask** - Alternative web framework (not used in your current app)
- **flask-cors** - Flask CORS handler (not needed with FastAPI)

## ?? For Your FastAPI App

Your application already has:
- ? **FastAPI CORS Middleware** (configured in `main.py`)
- ? **Anthropic SDK** now updated to latest version (0.71.0)
- ? **python-dotenv** for `.env` file support

## ?? Important Note

You now have **both Flask and FastAPI** installed. This is fine, but:
- Your current app uses **FastAPI**
- Flask is installed but not used
- flask-cors is not needed (FastAPI has its own CORS middleware)

## ?? What's Ready

With the latest Anthropic SDK (0.71.0), your FastAPI app is ready to use:
- ? Claude 4.5 Sonnet model
- ? Automatic date/time context
- ? Content moderation
- ? Smart replies
- ? All AI endpoints

## ?? Current requirements.txt

Your `requirements.txt` includes FastAPI packages:
```
fastapi>=0.100.0
uvicorn>=0.20.0
anthropic>=0.19.0  # Will use newly installed 0.71.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
# ... and more
```

## ? Summary

**Installation:** ? Complete  
**Latest Anthropic SDK:** ? 0.71.0  
**Flask Installed:** ? (if needed for other projects)  
**Your FastAPI App:** ? Ready to use with latest Claude SDK  

---

**Note:** If you only need FastAPI (which is what your current app uses), you don't need Flask. But having both installed won't cause issues.
