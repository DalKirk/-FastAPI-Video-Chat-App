ðŸš€ FIXED: Room Joining Issue

PROBLEM: Railway was running the OLD version (496 lines) instead of optimized version (341 lines)
SOLUTION: Deploy the optimized main.py to Railway

## ðŸ”§ DEPLOY OPTIMIZED VERSION TO RAILWAY

### Files to Upload:
1. main.py (NOW CORRECTED - optimized version with working room joins)
2. requirements.txt  
3. Procfile
4. runtime.txt

### Steps:
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Open project: web-production-ab54a
3. Upload the NEW main.py file (341 lines, not 496)
4. Railway will auto-redeploy

### How to Verify Correct Version:
âœ… Page loads fast on mobile
âœ… Compact, clean interface
âœ… Room joining works properly
âœ… WebSocket connects with wss:// on HTTPS

### The Key Fix:
The optimized version has proper WebSocket URL detection:
```javascript
const wsUrl=(window.location.protocol==='https:'?'wss://':'ws://')+window.location.host+'/ws/'+roomId+'/'+currentUser.id;
```

This automatically uses:
- ws:// for local HTTP
- wss:// for Railway HTTPS

### Expected Result After Deployment:
âœ… Mobile loads without white screen
âœ… Can create users âœ… 
âœ… Can create rooms âœ…
âœ… Can JOIN rooms âœ… (FIXED!)
âœ… Real-time chat works âœ…
