# ?? Frontend Not Sending Messages - FIXED

## Problem
- Backend logs show health checks (200 OK) ?
- Backend logs show Claude initialized ?
- But NO `POST /api/v1/chat` requests appearing ?
- Messages not being sent from frontend

## Root Cause
Frontend `api.js` was using:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
```

If `REACT_APP_API_URL` wasn't set in Vercel, it defaulted to `localhost:8000`, which doesn't work in production.

## ? Fix Applied
Updated `frontend/src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://fastapi-video-chat-app-production.up.railway.app';
```

Plus added debug logging to help troubleshoot.

## ?? How to Test

### Step 1: Redeploy Frontend
1. Go to Vercel ? Your Project
2. Click **Deployments**
3. Click **Redeploy** on latest

OR wait for auto-deploy from GitHub (2-3 minutes)

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
1. Open your chat app
2. Press **F12** ? **Console** tab
3. Type a message and send

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
You should see:
```
?? Sending message to: https://fastapi-video-chat-app-production.up.railway.app
?? Message: Hello
?? Response status: 200
? Success! Response: {content: "...", format_type: "...", ...}
```

### Step 4: Check Railway Logs
You should NOW see:
```
INFO: POST /api/v1/chat HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

## ?? Expected Behavior

### ? What Should Happen
1. Type message in frontend
2. Browser console shows `?? Sending message to: https://...`
3. Railway logs show `POST /api/v1/chat`
4. AI response appears in chat

### ? If Still Not Working

**Check Browser Console for:**

1. **CORS Error:**
```
Access to fetch ... has been blocked by CORS policy
```
**Fix:** Add your Vercel URL to `allowed_origins` in `main.py`

2. **Network Error:**
```
Failed to fetch
```
**Fix:** Check Railway is running

3. **Wrong URL:**
```
?? Sending message to: http://localhost:8000
```
**Fix:** Clear browser cache, hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## ?? Alternative: Set Environment Variable

For production, it's better to set the env var in Vercel:

1. Vercel ? Settings ? Environment Variables
2. Add:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://fastapi-video-chat-app-production.up.railway.app
   ```
3. Redeploy

Then revert the hardcoded URL in `api.js` (or keep it as fallback).

## ?? Verification Checklist

- [ ] Frontend redeployed
- [ ] Browser console shows `?? Sending message to: https://...`
- [ ] Railway logs show `POST /api/v1/chat`
- [ ] AI response appears in chat
- [ ] No errors in console

## ?? Success Indicators

**Backend Logs:**
```
