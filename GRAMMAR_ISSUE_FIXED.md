## ? FIXED!

The word spacing issue in Claude AI outputs has been **completely fixed and deployed to production**.

---

## ?? What Was Wrong

**Before Fix (Broken):**
```
Input:  "FastAPI is a modern framework for building APIs"
Output: "Fast API is a modern framework for building APIs"
         ^^^^^^^ ? WRONG - technical term split incorrectly
```

**After Fix (Working):**
```
Input:  "FastAPI is a modern framework for building APIs"
Output: "FastAPI is a modern framework for building APIs"
         ^^^^^^^ ? CORRECT - technical term preserved
```

---

## ?? Live Demonstration

I just ran a live test and here are the results:

### ? Technical Terms Preserved
```
? FastAPI     ? FastAPI     (preserved)
? JavaScript  ? JavaScript  (preserved)
? PostgreSQL  ? PostgreSQL  (preserved)
? WebSocket   ? WebSocket   (preserved)
? TypeScript  ? TypeScript  (preserved)
```

### ? Punctuation Spacing Fixed
```

? Hi,there        ? Hi, there         (space added)
? Note:Important  ? Note: Important   (space added)
? Great!Let's go  ? Great! Let's go   (space added)
```

### ? Correct Text Unchanged
```
? Hello, world!      ? Hello, world!      (unchanged)
? FastAPI is great.  ? FastAPI is great.  (unchanged)
```

## ?? What Changed

### File: `utils/streaming_ai_endpoints.py`

**Old (Broken):**
- Used aggressive regex that split ALL camelCase words
- Split "FastAPI" into "Fast API" ?
- Split "JavaScript" into "Java Script" ?

**New (Fixed):**
- Only adds spaces after punctuation where missing
- Preserves technical terms like "FastAPI" ?
- Preserves proper nouns and acronyms ?

**Code:**
```python
def format_claude_response(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Only adds spaces where genuinely missing (after punctuation),
    but preserves proper nouns, technical terms, and acronyms.
    """
    # Add space after period before capital
    text = re.sub(r'\.([A-Z])', r'. \1', text)
    
    # Add space after comma before any letter
    text = re.sub(r',([A-Za-z])', r', \1', text)
    
    # Add space after colon before any letter
    text = re.sub(r':([A-Za-z])', r': \1', text)
    
    # Add space before opening parenthesis
    text = re.sub(r'([A-Za-z0-9])\(', r'\1 (', text)
    
    # Add space after closing parenthesis before capital
    text = re.sub(r'\)([A-Z])', r') \1', text)
    
    # Add space after exclamation/question mark
    text = re.sub(r'([!?])([A-Z])', r'\1 \2', text)
    
    # NO MORE aggressive camelCase splitting!
    
    return text
```
