## ?? Test It Right Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Server (30 seconds)
```powershell
# Option A: Use quick start script
.\quick_start_test.ps1

# Option B: Manual start
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Step 2: Open Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:8000/chat**

### Step 3: Try It Out
1. **Create User:** Type "TestUser" ? Click "Create User" ? ? See "User created"
2. **Create Room:** Type "TestRoom" ? Click "Create Room" ? Click "Load Rooms"
3. **Join Room:** Click "Join" button ? ? **Chat interface appears!**
4. **Send Message:** Type "Hello!" ? Press Enter ? ? **Message appears!**

**That's it!** If you see the chat interface and can send messages, it's working! ??

## ?? Still Not Working?

### Run Diagnostics:
```bash
python diagnose_chat_rooms.py
```

This will tell you exactly what's wrong.

### Common Issues:

**Problem:** "Create user first" alert  
**Fix:** Click "Create User" before clicking "Join"

**Problem:** "Failed to join room: Room not found"  
**Fix:** Click "Create Room" and "Load Rooms" before joining

**Problem:** Server not responding  
**Fix:** Make sure server is running: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`
